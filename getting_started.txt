Starting to learn git, and github... Exciting so far...

learnt a few git commands:

At start :
	git config --global user.name "Your Name"    // double quotes necessary
	git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"   //double quotes not necessary

other commands
        git clone (url)		//url is that of our repository
	git add (file names with extension)	//stuff to add shoud be present in the same folder as our current directory
	git commit -m "committed message" (file names with extension) 	//to save changes	
	git push -u origin master	//to transfer files to github account		

other useful commands
	git status	//to check the status of our repository

to make changes to your file and upload it:
	make changes, save the file, then on the git bash: reuse commit and push commands.
